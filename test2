I hope this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, I may need to move back to Islamabad, Pakistan, to assist my parents with family matters while my older brother is in the UK. Unfortunately, my brother's firm has requested him to relocate to the UK, necessitating my immediate move.

Please consider this email as my official resignation from my current role. My last working day will be July 30, 2024.

I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences I've had here and appreciate all the support from the team. I look forward to the possibility of working together again in the future.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
