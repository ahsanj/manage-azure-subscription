Hub:
The hub is the central Log Analytics workspace (East US, in our previous example).
It serves as the main repository for all logs from various spoke regions.
The hub provides a unified view of logs across all regions, enabling centralized monitoring, analysis, and reporting.
Spoke Regions:
Each spoke region (e.g., West US, North Europe, etc.) has its own local Log Analytics workspace.
Local logs are collected, processed, and analyzed in each spoke region, allowing for real-time insights and quick decision-making.
Each spoke region can have its own unique log collection, processing, and analysis requirements, which are addressed locally.
Log Forwarding:
Logs from each spoke region are forwarded to the central hub workspace.
This ensures that all logs are stored in a single, centralized repository for long-term retention, analysis, and reporting.
Benefits:
The hub and spoke model enables both centralized and local log analysis, providing a comprehensive view of logs across all regions.
Local log analysis in each spoke region allows for faster insights and decision-making.
Centralized log management in the hub enables unified monitoring, reporting, and compliance.
